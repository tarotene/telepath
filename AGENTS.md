## Workspace Overview

| Crate | Role | Target |
|-------|------|--------|
| `telepath-wire` | Shared wire protocol types | server + client |
| `telepath-macros` | `#[command]` proc-macro | server (build time only) |
| `telepath-server` | Target-side RPC server library | `thumbv7em-none-eabi` |
| `telepath-client` | Host-side RPC client library; `rtt` and `serial` Cargo features select the transport | native (`std`) |
| `examples/host-pty-server` | Host-side server deployment over a PTY pair (hardware-free regression) | native (`std`) |
| `examples/nrf52840-ping` | Reference server deployment on nRF52840-DK | `thumbv7em-none-eabi` |
| `tools/telepath` | Unified CLI: `telepath shell` (interactive REPL) and `telepath mcp` (MCP server); `default = ["shell", "mcp", "rtt"]`, `serial` opt-in | native (`std`) |

## Documentation Source of Truth

This repository uses a layered documentation model. Each topic has a single
canonical home (Source of Truth, SoT); all other documents link to it instead
of duplicating content. Audit cycles (latest: 2026-05, #127) verify compliance.

**Layering rules:**
- `AGENTS.md` = SoT for build commands, workspace structure, CI gates,
  MSRV policy, git hooks, and workflow rules
- Crate-level `README.md` = SoT for that crate's API surface, usage examples,
  and Limitations
- Root `README.md` = user-facing narrative; quickstart lives here, other
  topics link to AGENTS or crate READMEs

**Topic → SoT mapping:**

| Topic | SoT | Other locations |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| Build commands | AGENTS.md § Build Commands | README.md quickstart |
| Workspace structure | AGENTS.md § Workspace Overview | README.md (summary + link) |
| `#[command]` signature contract | `telepath-macros/README.md` § Signature contract | AGENTS.md (summary), `telepath-server/README.md` (link) |
| `#[resource]` injection pattern | `examples/nrf52840-ping/README.md` § Resource injection | AGENTS.md (prose only, no code) |
| Server-side usage | `telepath-server/README.md` § Usage | README.md (teaser + link) |
| Quickstart / host-pty-smoke | README.md § Quickstart | `tools/telepath/README.md` (link), `examples/host-pty-server/README.md` (link) |
| Git hooks | AGENTS.md § Git Hooks | README.md (single command + link) |
| MSRV policy | AGENTS.md § MSRV policy | README.md (defers to AGENTS) |
| CI gates | AGENTS.md § Required CI gates | — |
| Release flow | AGENTS.md § How releases work | README.md (summary + link), `docs/releasing.md` (recovery/override) |
| Release recovery / version override | `docs/releasing.md` | AGENTS.md (reference only) |

**Limitations sections**: each crate README's `## Limitations` MUST reference
an open issue and MUST be removed in the same PR that implements the feature
(see README Limitations Lifecycle in the user-global AGENTS.md).

## Build Commands

```
# Host workspace (all 5 members including host-pty-server)
cargo build --workspace

# Run host-pty-server (prints slave PTY path; connect telepath shell --transport serial to that path)
cargo run -p host-pty-server

# Full hardware-free smoke via just (spawns server + serial shell, asserts ping)
just host-pty-smoke

# Host tests
cargo test --workspace

# Server example — cd required so .cargo/config.toml is discovered
cd examples/nrf52840-ping && cargo build --release

# Flash to nRF52840-DK (probe-rs download: flashes and exits, probe released)
cd examples/nrf52840-ping && cargo run --release

# Telepath unified CLI (excluded from workspace — requires cd)
# Default build: shell + mcp + rtt
cd tools/telepath && cargo build
cd tools/telepath && cargo run -- shell --exec ping
cd tools/telepath && cargo run -- shell
# Serial build: shell subcommand with serial transport
cd tools/telepath && cargo build --no-default-features --features shell,serial
cd tools/telepath && cargo run --no-default-features --features shell,serial -- shell --transport serial --port /dev/ttyACM0
# MCP server: default build includes mcp subcommand
cd tools/telepath && cargo run -- mcp
cd tools/telepath && cargo test

# Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Clippy (warnings are errors)
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings

# All CI checks at once
just ci
```

## Critical Constraints

### `telepath-wire`
- MUST NOT use `alloc` or `std`. The crate is `#![no_std]` and no heap allocation is permitted.
- All types MUST implement `serde::Serialize + serde::Deserialize` with `default-features = false`.
- Lifetime-parameterised types (e.g. `Request<'a>`) MUST borrow from the receive buffer to achieve zero-copy deserialization.

### `examples/nrf52840-ping`
- MUST be built separately; it is excluded from the workspace (`exclude = [...]` in root `Cargo.toml`).
- MUST NOT be added to the workspace `members` list; it has its own `target` directory and Cargo config.
- Cross-compilation REQUIRES `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi`.
- `cargo run --release` invokes `probe-rs download` (flash + exit). The probe is released immediately so `telepath shell` (with RTT transport) can attach.

### `examples/host-pty-server`
- IS a workspace member (`std` target, no cross-compile). Build with `cargo build --workspace`.
- MUST exercise the full wire path including COBS framing via a real PTY transport — it is the primary hardware-free regression for `telepath-server` and the serial path of `telepath-client`.
- MUST use only public APIs of the dependent crates; it MUST NOT poke internal state to aid the round-trip.
- On startup, prints `HOST_PTY_SERVER_PATH=<path>` to stdout then flushes; the test harness reads this to obtain the slave device path.
- CI spawns `host-pty-server` in background, reads the slave path, runs `telepath shell --transport serial --port <path> --exec ping`, and grep-asserts `ping -> 0xDEADBEEF`.

### `tools/telepath`
- MUST be built separately; it is excluded from the workspace (`exclude = [...]` in root `Cargo.toml`).
- MUST NOT be built with `cargo build -p telepath` from the workspace root (not a workspace member).
- Pure conversion modules (`codec/schema_to_json`, `codec/json_to_postcard`, `codec/postcard_to_json`) MUST remain side-effect free and sync; async lives only in `mcp/server.rs`.
- All MCP subcommand logging MUST go to `stderr`; `stdout` is reserved for the MCP JSON-RPC stream.
- Server MUST be flashed (and probe released) before invoking the shell subcommand with RTT transport.

### `telepath-server`
- MUST remain `#![no_std]`.
- MUST NOT depend on `std` or `alloc` directly.

## Wire Protocol Rules

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Downstream framing (Host→Target) | COBS; delimiter `0x00`; MCU decoder is a simple `read_until(0x00)` state machine |
| Upstream framing (Target→Host) | rzCOBS; `0x00` delimiter |
| Serialization | postcard (little-endian, varint-compressed) |
| Packet type | 2-valued: `Request` (0x01) / `Response` (0x02); follows ONC RPC RFC 5531 CALL/REPLY model |
| Error representation | `ResponseStatus` field inside `Response`; NOT a separate packet type |
| Discovery CmdID | `0x0000` — RESERVED for Command Discovery Protocol (CDP); follows CoAP Empty / ONC RPC NULL convention |
| Max payload | 256 bytes (`MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE`) |

## `#[command]` Macro

`#[command]` accepts plain free functions only. Wire args must be
`T: Serialize + DeserializeOwned + postcard_schema::Schema` (owned); `&T`/`&mut T`
requires the `#[resource]` attribute. `async`/`unsafe`/generics/methods are rejected
at compile time. CmdID is derived from wire args only — adding or removing a
`#[resource]` argument is **not** a breaking wire change.

For the full signature contract, generated items, and wire encoding details see
[telepath-macros/README.md § Signature contract](telepath-macros/README.md#signature-contract).

Changes to the macro MUST NOT break existing callers on stable toolchain.

### Peripheral Access

`#[resource]` is the recommended — and idiomatic — mechanism for giving
`#[command]` functions access to peripherals and other global mutable state.
Prefer it for all new code.

Worked example: [examples/nrf52840-ping/README.md § Resource injection](examples/nrf52840-ping/README.md#resource-injection)
and [`examples/nrf52840-ping/src/main.rs`](examples/nrf52840-ping/src/main.rs).

**Runtime invariants:**

- Each resource type may appear **at most once** in the registry; registering a
  second value of the same type panics at runtime (fail-fast to prevent silent
  shadowing). Duplicate `#[resource]` arguments within a single `#[command]`
  signature are additionally rejected at compile time by the proc-macro.
- `T: 'static` is required — HAL types with lifetime parameters must be newtype-wrapped
  and `transmute`d to `'static` (the soundness obligation rests with the crate author).
- Resource arguments are **wire-transparent**: they are not serialized into the wire
  payload and do not affect the `cmd_id` calculation.  Adding or removing a
  `#[resource]` argument is therefore **not a breaking wire change**.

**Legacy pattern:** If `#[resource]` cannot be adopted (e.g. the peripheral is already
shared via a `static Mutex<RefCell<Option<T>>>` elsewhere in the firmware), that pattern
remains valid and is equally wire-transparent — `#[command]` functions may close over
global statics directly.  New code SHOULD prefer `#[resource]`.

## Commit and PR Rules

- Follow Conventional Commits: `feat(wire): add CRC field to Request`
  Enforced locally by the `commit-msg` hook via cocogitto (`cog verify`).
- Feature branches MUST be created before any code change.
- PRs MUST reference the corresponding GitHub Issue.
- `examples/nrf52840-ping/` changes SHOULD be a separate commit from workspace changes.
- PRs that touch any of the following SHOULD be smoke-tested with `just firmware-ping`
  against a connected nRF52840-DK before requesting review, and the result recorded in
  the PR description's Test plan section:
  - `telepath-wire/`, `telepath-macros/`, `telepath-server/`, `telepath-client/`
  - `tools/telepath/`
  - `examples/nrf52840-ping/`

  This catches FW/host wire-format skew that `just ci` alone cannot detect without hardware.

### How releases work

**Humans MUST NOT create git tags or GitHub Releases manually.**
Everything is driven by release-plz via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release-plz.yml`).

#### Normal release cycle

1. Merge any PR whose commits include `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, or `refactor:` prefixes.
2. The `release-plz-pr` job opens a `chore: release vX.Y.Z` PR automatically with:
   - Workspace `Cargo.toml` version bump
   - `CHANGELOG.md` entry
   - `release` label
3. The `release-plz-pr` job automatically bumps `tools/telepath` and
   `examples/nrf52840-ping` to the new version and pushes a commit
   (`chore(release): bump excluded crates to X.Y.Z`) onto the release PR branch.
   **No manual action is required.** (See step 3 in
   [`docs/releasing.md § Excluded crates`](docs/releasing.md#excluded-crates-bump-excluded-requirement)
   for recovery if the automatic step fails.)
4. Review and merge the release PR.
5. The `release-plz-release` job creates a **draft** GitHub Release tagged `vX.Y.Z`,
   covering all five workspace members (unified versioning).
6. The `release-binaries` job (triggered by `release-plz-release`) builds prebuilt
   binaries for 4 targets, attaches them to the draft release, then publishes it via
   `gh release edit --draft=false`.  The immutable lock is applied only after all
   assets are attached.  If this job fails, the release stays as a draft and can be
   retried: `gh workflow run release-binaries.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z`.

#### What release-plz does NOT do

- Create per-crate GitHub Releases (only `telepath-wire` is the canonical release owner)
- Run on PRs — only on pushes to `main`

> **Authentication**: Publishing uses Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
> secret is required. `id-token: write` is set on the `release-plz-release` job so GitHub
> Actions can exchange a short-lived OIDC token with crates.io. When adding a new publishable
> crate, you must perform a manual bootstrap: `cargo publish` the first version with a
> short-lived API token (scopes: `publish-new`, ~7-day expiry), then add a Trusted Publishing
> entry for the new crate at `https://crates.io/crates/<name>/settings`, then revoke the token.
> From the second release onward, the release-plz workflow handles publishing via OIDC.
> See [`docs/releasing.md § Trusted Publishing`](docs/releasing.md#trusted-publishing).

> **GitHub App token**: The `release-plz-pr` and `release-plz-release` jobs use a
> GitHub App installation token (via `actions/create-github-app-token`) rather than
> `GITHUB_TOKEN` for all GitHub-object-creating steps. This allows release PRs and
> GitHub Releases to trigger downstream workflow runs (required status checks) —
> `GITHUB_TOKEN`-originated events are silently suppressed by GitHub's anti-recursion
> guard. The `release-binaries` job is called directly via `workflow_call` from
> `release-plz-release`, so it does not rely on a `release: published` event trigger
> and is therefore unaffected by the anti-recursion guard. The token is generated from
> secrets `RELEASE_PLZ_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_PLZ_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
> See [`docs/releasing.md § Setup: GitHub App token`](docs/releasing.md#setup-github-app-token)
> for App creation and secret configuration.

#### Debugging / recovery

See [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for retrigger, version override, and recovery procedures.

#### Release scheduling model (hybrid)

| Change type | Version | When to merge the Release PR |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------|
| Bug fix / non-breaking improvement | Patch (`v0.X.(Y+1)`) | As soon as it is ready |
| Feature addition (non-breaking) | Minor (`v0.(X+1).0`) | When the target Milestone is 100% closed |
| Breaking change | Minor (`v0.(X+1).0`, pre-1.0) | **Always bundle into a Minor Milestone** |

**Wire-protocol breaking changes** (e.g. rzCOBS framing) require firmware and host to update
simultaneously; never release them in isolation.

A `release-nudge` workflow (`.github/workflows/release-nudge.yml`) posts a weekly comment on
any Release PR that has been open for more than 7 days. If no Release PR exists despite
qualifying commits on `main`, the release-plz workflow failed — see `docs/releasing.md § Retriggering`.

## Toolchain

- Channel: `stable` (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- MSRV: `1.88` (declared via `rust-version` in all `Cargo.toml` files and `constraints.rust` in `renovate.json` — note: Renovate's `semver` versioning rejects ranges, so use a single `X.Y.Z` literal, e.g. `1.88.0`)
- When bumping MSRV, update `rust-version` in all manifests **and** `constraints.rust` in `renovate.json` (`X.Y.Z` literal, NOT a range) in the same PR.
  Renovate will NOT auto-propose this change (the `renovate-config`/`rust` packageRule sets `enabled: false` — see § Dependency Management); the update MUST be made manually as part of the `feat(toolchain)!` commit.
- Additional target: `thumbv7em-none-eabi`
- Recommended tools: `just`, `probe-rs`, `cargo-expand` (for macro debugging), `cocogitto` (commit-msg validation)

### MSRV policy

The MSRV is verified in CI (`msrv` job, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.88.0`).
Bumping the MSRV is a MINOR change for pre-1.0 releases and MUST use the
commit convention `feat(toolchain)!: bump MSRV to 1.XX`.

### Required CI gates

The repository uses **three layered Rulesets** targeting `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` (`main`):

| Ruleset | id | Rules | bypass actors |
|---------|-----|-------|---------------|
| `Security` | `17066999` | `deletion`, `non_fast_forward` | none (absolute) |
| `Quality` | `17067250` | `required_status_checks`, `required_signatures`, `required_linear_history` | none (absolute) |
| `Workflow` | `13908758` | `pull_request` (squash-only, thread resolution; no review required), `copilot_code_review` | none |

When multiple rulesets target the same branch, GitHub enforces the **most restrictive**
combination.  The three-way split ensures that `Security` and `Quality` remain absolute
regardless of `Workflow` configuration.

The following jobs are registered as **required status checks** in the `Quality` Ruleset:

| Job name | Category | Required |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `Format check` | Style gate | YES |
| `Host (clippy + test + smoke)` | Correctness + Smoke | YES |
| `MSRV (1.88)` | Policy gate | YES |
| `Firmware (cross-compile nRF52840-DK)` | Cross-compile correctness | YES |
| `Tools (telepath CLI clippy + tests)` | Correctness (tools/telepath) | YES (added PR #110) |
| `Release binaries (4 targets)` | Release artifact pipeline | NO (release-only trigger; cannot gate PRs) |

**Decision criteria for promoting a job to Required:**
- Correctness / Style / Policy gates → SHOULD be required
- Hardware-dependent jobs (e.g. `firmware-ping`) → NOT required without a self-hosted runner
- Experimental or known-flaky jobs → NOT required until stable across ≥5 consecutive PRs
- Ruleset updates MUST be applied via API so changes are auditable:
  - `Security` (`id=17066999`): `gh api -X PUT repos/.../rulesets/17066999`
  - `Quality`  (`id=17067250`): `gh api -X PUT repos/.../rulesets/17067250`
  - `Workflow` (`id=13908758`): `gh api -X PUT repos/.../rulesets/13908758`

### CI tool installation policy

When adding new tooling to CI workflows, choose the delivery mechanism in this order:

1. **Dedicated setup-action** — e.g. `rui314/setup-mold`, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`. Fastest; no compile step.
2. **`taiki-e/install-action`** — for tools listed in its manifest (e.g. `just`, `nextest`). Pre-built binary download.
3. **`cargo-binstall`** — for crates with published binaries not covered above.
4. **`cargo install --locked` from source** — last resort only; adds minutes of compile time to every run.

`cargo install` from source MUST NOT be used in CI unless the tool has no binary distribution.

### CI workflow file layout

CI uses **five PR-gate workflows**, **three release/maintenance workflows**, and **one composite action**:

#### PR-gate workflows (required status checks)

| File | Required check name | Trigger scope |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| `.github/workflows/fmt.yml` | `Format check` | Any `.rs`, `Justfile`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workflow/action self |
| `.github/workflows/host.yml` | `Host (clippy + test + smoke)` | `telepath-{wire,server,client,macros}/`, `examples/host-pty-server/`, root `Cargo.{toml,lock}`, `Justfile`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workflow/action self |
| `.github/workflows/tools.yml` | `Tools (telepath CLI clippy + tests)` | `telepath-{wire,client,macros}/`, `tools/telepath/`, root `Cargo.{toml,lock}`, `Justfile`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workflow/action self |
| `.github/workflows/msrv.yml` | `MSRV (1.88)` | All crate dirs, root `Cargo.{toml,lock}`, `Justfile`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workflow/action self |
| `.github/workflows/firmware.yml` | `Firmware (cross-compile nRF52840-DK)` | `telepath-{wire,server,macros}/`, `examples/nrf52840-ping/`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, workflow/action self (root `Cargo.*` excluded — separate workspace) |

#### Release and maintenance workflows (not PR-gate checks)

| File | Purpose | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml` | Build pre-built binaries for 4 targets, attach to draft release, publish | `workflow_call` (from `release-plz.yml`); `workflow_dispatch` with optional `tag` input for backfill / dry-run |
| `.github/workflows/release-plz.yml` | Open release PRs and publish to crates.io | Push to `main`; `workflow_dispatch` to retrigger |
| `.github/workflows/release-nudge.yml` | Post weekly reminder on stale release PRs | Weekly schedule |

Common setup (toolchain, libudev, just, rust-cache) lives in
`.github/actions/rust-setup/action.yml` (composite action). Modify it to apply
changes uniformly across all workflows.

### Path-filtering and job skip strategy

Each CI workflow contains a `Detect relevant changes` step that runs `git diff`
between the **merge-base** of the PR base SHA and HEAD. If no relevant files changed,
all subsequent steps are skipped and the workflow still exits **successfully** — required
status checks remain satisfied because GHA reports a job with all steps skipped as success.

No external path-filter action is used; `permissions: contents: read` is sufficient.
`actions/checkout@v4` runs with `fetch-depth: 0` (full history) to guarantee that
`git merge-base` can resolve the common ancestor. Using the merge-base instead of a raw
two-dot diff prevents false positives when main advances after a PR branches off — only
commits that belong to the PR contribute to the changed-file list.
`git fetch origin "$BASE" --depth=1` in the guard ensures the base commit object is
present (needed for fork PRs where the base ref may not be fetched automatically).
If the merge-base or base SHA is unavailable (new branch / zero SHA / fetch error),
the guard defaults to `run=true` (**safe-by-default** principle — prefer false positives
over silently skipping valid checks).

## Lockfile Policy

- `Cargo.lock` is committed for all manifest groups: workspace root, `tools/telepath`, and `examples/nrf52840-ping`.
- Rationale: (1) current Cargo FAQ defaults to committing; (2) `tools/telepath` and `nrf52840-ping` are
  binary crates where reproducible builds matter; (3) firmware requires deterministic binaries.
- Downstream consumers of the library crates (`telepath-wire`, `telepath-client`, etc.) do **not** use
  this lockfile for dependency resolution — that is standard Cargo behaviour.
- `tools/telepath/Cargo.toml` and `examples/nrf52840-ping/Cargo.toml` carry an empty `[workspace]` table
  to make them self-contained workspaces, stopping Cargo's upward traversal at their own manifest.

## Dependency Management

- Renovate (`renovate.json`) opens dependency-bump PRs every Monday 06:00 JST. Monthly lockfile maintenance PR on the first of the month.
- All Renovate PRs require human review; automerge is disabled.
- `rangeStrategy: "auto"` (= `update-lockfile`) keeps `Cargo.toml` semver ranges stable; only `Cargo.lock` is bumped.
- `probe-rs` is intentionally pinned to `0.31.x` in `telepath-client/Cargo.toml` and `tools/telepath/Cargo.toml`.
  Patch updates are PR'd as a synchronized group. Major/minor bumps require Dependency Dashboard approval.
  To lift the pin, remove the `dependencyDashboardApproval: true` packageRule for probe-rs in
  `renovate.json` and update both `telepath-client/Cargo.toml` and `tools/telepath/Cargo.toml` to allow
  the desired version range.
- Embedded HAL updates (`embassy-*`, `nrf-pac`, `cortex-m-rt`, etc.) carry the `needs-smoke-test` label.
  Run `just firmware-ping` on a connected nRF52840-DK and record the result in the PR before merging.
- `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` is excluded from Renovate (channel reference, not a version tag).
- `constraints.rust` (`1.88.0`) is the MSRV pin; a `renovate-config`/`rust` packageRule sets `enabled: false`
  so Renovate cannot self-bump it via the docker datasource (the misleading "rust Docker tag" update seen
  in the Dependency Dashboard). Without this rule the value drifts silently — see git history #151/#169/#190
  (three renovate[bot] bumps), reverted by #217. MSRV changes are deliberate `feat(toolchain)!` edits only
  (see § Toolchain for the full update checklist).
- Dependency Dashboard Issue lists all suppressed updates for visibility.

## Git Hooks

After cloning, contributors MUST run:

```
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

- `commit-msg` → `cog verify` (instant; runs on every commit message)
- `pre-commit` → `just fmt-check` (sub-second; runs on every commit)
- `pre-push` → `just clippy` + `just test` (~30 s; runs before every push)
- `just ci` (fmt-check + clippy + test + host-pty-smoke + mcp-test) SHOULD be run before opening a PR.
- `just firmware-ping` SHOULD additionally be run when the PR touches wire / macros /
  server / client / shell / nrf52840-ping (see "Commit and PR Rules" above).
